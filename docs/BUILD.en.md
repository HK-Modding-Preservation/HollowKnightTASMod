# Build guide

[中文](BUILD.md)

The project contains a .NET Framework game Runtime, .NET Studio/CLI/MCP/SDK tools, and a Windows C library for native frame control. Build on Windows x64.

## Prerequisites and layout

Install the .NET 8 SDK, .NET Framework 4.7.2 targeting assemblies, PowerShell 7.2 or newer, and x64 MinGW GCC. The game must have Modding API installed and provide the referenced assemblies, including `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `MMHOOK_Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `MMHOOK_PlayMaker.dll`, Unity modules, PlayMaker, MonoMod and Mono.Cecil.

| Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src` | Runtime, Core, Companion, CLI, AgentBridge, automation SDK and build tools |
| `native` | Native frame control, startup gate and save-write protection |
| `tests` | Unit, protocol and WPF interface tests |
| `fixtures` / `schemas` | Reusable test inputs and data constraints |
| `scripts` | Build, packaging and validation scripts |
| `packaging` | Companion build inputs and generated directories |

From the repository root, copy the local configuration template and set both paths:

```powershell
Copy-Item LocalBuildProperties.props.example LocalBuildProperties.props
```

```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <HKManagedDir>D:\Games\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed</HKManagedDir>
    <HKModsDir>D:\Games\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods</HKModsDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

`LocalBuildProperties.props`, signing keys, build output, temporary artifacts and development notes stay local and are excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Compile and test

Run all commands from the repository root. To compile without installing:

```powershell
dotnet restore HollowKnightTAS.sln
dotnet build HollowKnightTAS.sln -c Release -p:SkipHKTASInstall=true
```

Runtime's default Build copies and packages files into `HKModsDir/HollowKnightTAS`. For development checks, explicitly pass `SkipHKTASInstall=true` to avoid replacing an installation in use.

Run tests appropriate to the change, for example:

```powershell
dotnet test tests/HollowKnightTAS.Core.Tests/HollowKnightTAS.Core.Tests.csproj -c Release -p:SkipHKTASInstall=true

dotnet test tests/HollowKnightTAS.Companion.Tests/HollowKnightTAS.Companion.Tests.csproj -c Release -p:SkipHKTASInstall=true --filter FullyQualifiedName~StudioThemeTests
```

WPF tests require Windows and should run in a separate test process. Compilation and offline tests do not establish in-game replay results for a particular game, Mod and save combination. Validate replay using the same build and matching environment.

## Sign the companion bundle

The complete Companion bundle includes Studio, native tools, ClockStartup, CLI, MCP and SDK. Its manifest signs the file list and hashes. Runtime and Companion verify it with embedded public keys.

To maintain an existing release identity, use its matching private and public keys. For an independent release, generate your own RSA keys:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/HollowKnightTAS.BundleTool -c Release -- keygen .local/signing/companion-private.json .local/signing/companion-public.json
dotnet run --project src/HollowKnightTAS.BundleTool -c Release -- print-public .local/signing/companion-public.json
```

Copy the printed modulus and exponent into `ModulusBase64` and `ExponentBase64` in both files before building:

- `src/HollowKnightTAS.Runtime/Companion/CompanionReleaseKey.cs`
- `src/HollowKnightTAS.Companion/Services/CompanionReleaseKey.cs`

Do not commit the private key or include it in a release. Generating a key without updating the embedded public keys causes bundle verification to fail at runtime. Key generation refuses to overwrite existing files.

## Build ClockStartup and the complete bundle

Specify the local game and GCC paths, then build ClockStartup into a directory that does not yet exist:

```powershell
./scripts/Build-T24ClockPrototype.ps1 -Configuration Release `
    -GameExecutable 'D:/Games/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.exe' `
    -GccExecutable 'C:/Tools/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe' `
    -OutputRoot "$PWD/artifacts/clock-local"
```

This script is the native clock build entry used by the complete bundle build. Its output is bound to the specified game executable, Unity and game assemblies.

Build and verify a staging bundle without changing the game installation:

```powershell
./scripts/Build-CompanionBundle.ps1 -Configuration Release -StageOnly `
    -GameExecutable 'D:/Games/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.exe' `
    -ClockBundleRoot "$PWD/artifacts/clock-local"
```

Keys default to `.local/signing`; override them with `-PrivateKeyPath` and `-PublicKeyPath`. The script regenerates `packaging/publish` and `packaging/staging/bundle`, publishes Studio as a self-contained `win-x64` application, signs the bundle and verifies it. `-StageOnly` does not build or install Runtime.

Save your edits and close the game and Studio. Omit `-StageOnly` to build and install the complete package:

```powershell
./scripts/Build-CompanionBundle.ps1 -Configuration Release `
    -GameExecutable 'D:/Games/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.exe' `
    -ClockBundleRoot "$PWD/artifacts/clock-local"
```

`HKModsDir` in `LocalBuildProperties.props` determines the installation location. The script checks that the game and Studio are closed, replaces Companion, builds Runtime and verifies the installed signed bundle. It produces `HollowKnightTAS.zip` and `SHA256.txt`. The zip root contains the Mod files; extract it into `Mods/HollowKnightTAS`.

## Package a release with documentation

`scripts/Package-StudioUpdate.ps1` packages an existing installation with Chinese and English versions of all three guides, without recompiling. Obtain and verify the lowercase SHA-256 hashes of the target installation's Runtime, Core and manifest, then pass them to the script:

```powershell
./scripts/Package-StudioUpdate.ps1 `
    -ModDirectory 'D:/Games/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/Mods/HollowKnightTAS' `
    -OutputPath "$PWD/artifacts/releases/HollowKnightTAS.zip" `
    -ExpectedRuntimeSha256 '<runtime-sha256>' `
    -ExpectedCoreSha256 '<core-sha256>' `
    -ExpectedManifestSha256 '<manifest-sha256>'
```

The script defaults to the Release BundleTool and local public key. Override these with `-BundleToolPath` and `-PublicKeyPath` when needed. The output path must not exist. Packaging verifies the installed signature and every file hash, then reads the resulting zip and verifies each entry. `-VerifyOnly` checks an existing archive against the current inputs.

Changing Runtime, Core, native clock code, the game or other Mods can change the environment identity. Distribute matching binaries together and retain the installation that matches a sequence. Recompilation alone does not establish compatibility with existing recordings.
